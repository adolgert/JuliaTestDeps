## common.csv

All of the packages found by the searches below. This has two columns.
The first is the name of the package and the second, if present, is the reason the package was excluded. These will be categories, such as "scientific" or "statistical", meaning the package is not for unit testing.


## juliahub.csv

This is a list of all files found using the search criterion "test". It will include statistical tests, which will be marked by hand.

## found.csv

I went through the testusebyname.csv to see what was used but not listed among the testing packages. Found some nice surprises.

Lists of groups of repositories that deal with testing packages.
